ofxPolygonHitTest
=================

OpenFrameworks addon to calculate hit test operations on rotated and scaled elements.

Based off of Paul Bourke 's site : http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/insidepoly/


Simple system and library for hit test on rotated objects useful for multitouch. I like to think of it as an improved friendly version of ofxPixelHitTest with a different methodology.
